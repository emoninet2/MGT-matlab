# Musical Gestures Toolbox for Matlab

MGT is a Matlab toolbox for analysing music-related body motion, using sets of audio, video and motion capture data as source material. 

The current version requires Matlab 2015, and builds on some other Matlab toolboxes: [matlabPyrTools](http://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52571-matlabpyrtools), [MoCap Toolbox](https://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/musiikki/en/research/coe/materials/mocaptoolbox) and [MIRtoolbox](https://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/musiikki/en/research/coe/materials/mirtoolbox). 

## Installation

*Important:Since many problems in Matlab2016,I suggest if anybody is still using Matlab2015a, please test it in Matlab2015a. Then I will make a new version for Matlab2016a.*

1. Install the dependencies: [matlabPyrTools](http://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52571-matlabpyrtools), [MoCap Toolbox](https://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/musiikki/en/research/coe/materials/mocaptoolbox) and [MIRtoolbox](https://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/musiikki/en/research/coe/materials/mirtoolbox)

2. Add the files in "source-code" to your Matlab path. In the matlab "Home" section, find "set path" and click it. Then it opens a file selection dialog. Next, click the "Add Folder" and choose the unzipped folder and finally click "save". 

## Usage

There are some test files (audio, video, mocap) in the "data" folder. Try out the m-files in the examples folder. 

## History

The [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Max](http://www.uio.no/english/research/groups/fourms/downloads/software/musicalgesturestoolbox/) has been developed by [alexarje](https://github.com/alexarje) since 2004, and parts of it is currently embedded in the Jamoma project. 

The first version of the Musical Gestures Toolbox for Matlab was made by [benlyyan](https://github.com/benlyyan) as part of his M.Sc. at the University of Oslo ([Video analysis of music-related body motion in Matlab](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/51118)), and is currently maintained by the [fourMs group](https://github.com/fourMs).
