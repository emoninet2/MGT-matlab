# Motion capture data example

This dataset is a recording of pianist Bill Westney, from the fourMs lab at the University of Oslo. The dataset consist of three files: 

- pianist.tsv: motion capture data from a Qualisys Oqus 300 system
- pianist.mp4: video recording
- pianist.wav: audio recording

The files are synchronized so that they can be used to test analysis of the three data types together with the Musical Gestures Toolbox. 

More of these files are available from the [fourMs mocap database](http://www.uio.no/english/research/groups/fourms/downloads/motion-capture/20100222-westney/index.html).
